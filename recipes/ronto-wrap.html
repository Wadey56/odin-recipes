    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Inspired by Chewbacca and similar to the ones available at the Disney
      Parks, these oatmeal sandwich cookies have a marshmallow filling and
      chocolate decoration!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three parts to these cookie sandwiches-oatmeal cookies,
      marshmallow filling, and a chocolate decoration.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Oatmeal Cookie</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups rolled oats</li>
      <li>1 cup and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Marshmallow Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/4 cups unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 jar (7.5 oz) marshmallow fluff or creme</li>
      <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chocolate Decoration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate melting wafers</li>
      <li>1/4 cup white chocolate melting wafers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Oatmeal Cookie</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, stir together the oats, flour, baking soda, baking
        powder, cinnamon, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and
        fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat until combined.
      </li>
      <li>Add the oat mixture and beat on low speed just until combined.</li>
      <li>
        Use a cookie scoop or spoon to place spoonfuls of dough onto the
        prepared baking sheets. The cookies will spread a bit, so place them 1 Â½
        to 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Use your fingers to slightly
        flatten the cookies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 12-14 minutes, until golden and just set. Let cool for 5
        minutes on the pan before transferring to a wire rack to cool
        completely. The cookies will be a bit crispy but soften with the
        marshmallow filling.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Chocolate Decoration</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the dark chocolate melting wafers in a disposable piping bag. Heat
        in the microwave, manipulating the bag every 30 seconds until melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pipe the chocolate into lines onto a wax paper lined baking sheet. Aim
        to have the lines the length of the diameter of the cookies. Use the
        offset spatula to lightly smooth the chocolate lines so that the surface
        is flat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chocolate lines into the refrigerator to set, about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the white chocolate melting wafers into a disposable piping bag.
        Heat in the microwave, manipulating the bag every 30 seconds until
        melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pipe two rows of small dashes onto the dark chocolate lines. Let set.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Marshmallow Filling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        On medium speed, beat the butter until light and fluffy, about 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the marshmallow fluff and beat on low speed until just combined,
        about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat on medium
        speed until fluffy. Make sure not to overbeat it as it will become
        tough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the filling to a piping bag fitted with a large round piping
        tip.
      </li>
      <li>Assembly</li>
      <li>
        Flip half of the cookies onto their tops so that their flat side is face
        up.
      </li>
      <li>Pipe a swirl of marshmallow filling onto the flipped cookies.</li>
      <li>
        Place a second cookie, flat side down, onto the marshmallow filling to
        make a cookie sandwich.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pipe a small dollop of marshmallow filling into the center of the tops
        of the cookie sandwiches. This will hold the chocolate pieces on the
        cookie.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently remove the chocolate decorations from the wax paper and place
        one, diagonally, onto the top of each cookie sandwich.
      </li>
      <li>Store in an airtight container.</li>
