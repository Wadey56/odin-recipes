    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This native Endorian dish is tasty and tender, commonly knows as the Endor
      Chicken, and paired with mash, vegetables, rice or mac & cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dish combines the crispy, succulent joy of fried chicken with the
      homey, rich flavors of house-made macaroni & cheese and perfectly roasted
      vegetables, particularly broccoli.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Large Boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>Oil for frying, such as vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Cups All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 Teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 Teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>Pinch of Cayenne Pepper</li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 Batch mashed potatoes</li>
      <li>1 Cup cooked mixed vegetables, such as peas, carrots, and corn</li>
      <li>Gravy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the chicken into small pieces and set aside. Fill a small saute pan
        with 2 inches of oil. Place over medium heat and begin to heat it up to
        around 350Â° while you prepare the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk together the flour (for gluten-free try Bob's Red
        Mill flour used by Disney), salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to
        mix evenly. In another small bowl, beat together the egg and the
        buttermilk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working with one piece at a time, dip the chicken into the egg mixture,
        then the flour (for gluten-free try Bob's Red Mill flour used by Disney)
        mixture, making sure it's well coated. Repeat sequence, then set the
        chicken aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once all the meat is coated, begin frying by lowering it into the hot
        oil a few pieces at a time. Flipping occasionally, cook for about 5 to
        10 minutes, until a nice dark golden brown color. Remove to a plate
        lined with paper towel to drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble the dish, stir together the mashed potatoes and the mixed
        vegetables. Add a generous dollop of this to each serving dish, then
        pour the gravy around the edge. Tumble several of the nuggets on top and
        enjoy straightaway.
      </li>
    </ol>
